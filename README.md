# Skincare Recommender System Based on Skin Problem Using Content-Based Filtering

## Overview

Nowadays, skincare is becoming one of the most essential parts of daily life. The skincare product market has grown rapidly and is increasing year by year.  
However, the large number of available options makes it difficult for users to choose products that best suit their facial needs.  

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a **Skincare Recommender System** based on **facial skin problems**.  
It uses **Content-Based Filtering** (without any rating data) to recommend products using **cosine similarity** and **TF-IDF** to find feature similarities.

âœ… Users receive product recommendations based on selected keywords and similar products.  
âœ… The system was deployed using **Streamlit**.

## Dataset

The dataset was independently scraped from various skincare product websites.

## How the Recommendation Works

- **Preprocessing**: TF-IDF is used to vectorize the `notable_effects`, `skin_type`, and `description` features.
- **Similarity Measure**: Cosine similarity calculates the similarity between products.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: The system recommends products based on the user's keyword selection and finds similar products.
